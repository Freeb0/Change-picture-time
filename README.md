# Change-picture-time

This is a code to change the meta data of pictures I took in Indonesia. The hour is 6 hours ahead in Bali and 5 hours ahead in Java. 
So I checked the date when I went from 1 Island to the other one and made it so that all pictures taken with a "Canon" camera, before 
that date get a shifted date 5 hours ahead and all pictures I took with that camera after that date get a shifted date 6 hours ahead.
